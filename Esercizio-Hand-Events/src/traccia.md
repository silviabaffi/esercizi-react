Create a MouseClicker component that contains a button with a name attribute set to the "one" string.

Attach an event handler to the button that prints the name attribute to the console when clicked by reading the event.target.name property.

Add another button with the name attribute set to "two" and an image inside the button and add another event handler to it that prints the src of the image to the console when clicked.

How can you prevent the name attribute of the button from being printed to the console when the image is clicked?
