Create an uncontrolled component called UncontrolledLogin, containing three inputs: a username input, a password input and a remember checkbox. Add a "login" button to the Login component.

When clicked, the event handler attached to the button should call an onLogin function that will print the values of the inputs.

Attempt to access the values of the form using the DOM API by reading the event.target of the onSubmit event handler.

Add a second button that call a loginWithFormData function that prints the values of the inputs by using the FormData API.
