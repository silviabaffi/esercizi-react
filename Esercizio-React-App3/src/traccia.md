Extend the chat application created in the previous exercises to allow the user to send new messages. The goal is to add an input field and a "Send" button that allow the user to type a new message and add it to the chat when sent.

Requirements:

When the user clicks "Send" or presses the "Enter" key, the new message is added to the array of existing messages.
Sending a new message should be prevented if the input field is empty or contains only spaces.
After sending the message, the input field should be cleared.
After sending the message, ensure that the chat window automatically scrolls to the bottom.
