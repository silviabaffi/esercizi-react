Create a TodoList component that renders a ul tag with a li tag for each item contained in the todos state variable.

The todos state variable should be an array of strings. The TodoList component should also contain an input tag and a button. When the button is clicked, the event handler should add the value of the input tag to the todos array.

Clear the input every time a Todo is added to the todos array.

Add a "reset" button that clears the todos array when clicked.

Add a "remove" button to each li tag. When clicked, the event handler should remove corresponding item from the todos array.
