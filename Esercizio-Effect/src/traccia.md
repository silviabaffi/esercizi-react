Create a Counter function component and create a new state variable called counter initialized to 0.

The Counter component should render the counter value within an h2 tag, and the counter value should be incremented every time the user clicks on a button.

Make it so that the initial value of the counter and the increment amount are passed as props to the component.

Add a side effect to the Counter component from first State exercise that prints the current value of the counter inside the console.

Build a Clock component that renders the current time within an h2 tag. Use the useEffect hook to update the time every second.
